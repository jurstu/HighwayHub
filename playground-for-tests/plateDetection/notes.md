# generally, how should one approach it

1. detect all plates on a image frame, as frequent as possible
2. track them all with something like norFair, later
3. based on track ID do consolidation of possible images of the plate
4. do a list of possible plate numbers for a single trackID, this results in


- many images of a single plate
-
